TS_PSDAGX test suite  - 7/12/01

The TS_PSDAGX test suite is a unit test for PSD.AGX. The test suite uses the IntegrationTest framework in order to run. 

The test specification for TS_PSDAGX is  

"\networking\psdagx\design\SGL.GT0116.300 PSDAGX Unit Test Spec.Doc"


In order to simulate various test conditions it was necessary to create dummy versions
of Nifman, Etel and AgentDialog. These three projects are stored under Genconn as TDummyNif, TDummyEtel and TDummyDlgSvr respectively. 

All this test code is linked with "dummypsd.agx" and "dummygenconn.agt". These two are just duplicates of the real psd.agx and genconn.agt. This avoids any problems where some parts of the test harness are linked with etel.lib and others are linked with dummyetel.lib

So in order to run the TS_PSDAGX test cases the following .DLLs and where necessary .LIBs must exist.

Scheduletest.exe
IntegrationTestUtils
DummyEtel
DummyAgentDialog
DummyNif
DummyGenconn
DummyPsd
TS_PSDAGX

Before running any test the CommDB must be correctly configured. Details of the configuration are given in Appendix A of the Unit Test Specification. The CdbV3.Dat file in this directory can be used to run the test cases. If tests fail the tester should double check the contents of the CommDB before looking any further into the problem.

To run the tests a script file must be used, the file psdagx.script is also in this directory and the following command line is used.

scheduletest psdagx

A log file psdagx.html is generated under the EPOC path C:\logs\TestResults
