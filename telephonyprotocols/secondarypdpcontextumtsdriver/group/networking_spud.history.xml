    <description>SPUDMAN was not sending IfProgress with the KDataTransferTemporarilyBlocked constant when the PDP context is suspended - this is expected to be sent to Nifman from a Nif supporting GPRS but SPUDMAN was discarding notifications from lower level NIFs so that they never reached Nifman.  This means RConnection::ProgressNotification never sent any KDataTransferTemporarilyBlocked progress updates to clients.  SPUDMAN has now been changed to produce the correct behaviour.</description>
