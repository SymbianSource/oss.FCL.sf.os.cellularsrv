    <description>The RawIP NIF and TRP PCO implementation is not correct.  TProtocolConfigOptionV2::iMiscBuffer is not the correct way to pass a gateway address - data needs to be passed in TLV format but there are no TLV content tags defined for a gateway address and any UMTS/GPRS hardware which claims to be able to supply this address is erroneous (3gpp standard 24.008, section 10.5.6.3).  We no longer pass any gateway information in the buffer so that other correctly formed parameters can be passed.</description>
