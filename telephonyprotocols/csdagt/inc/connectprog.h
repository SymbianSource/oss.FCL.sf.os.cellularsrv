// Stages in establishing a connection with NetDial

 /**
 * Defines the stages in establishing a connection with dial-up networking.
 *
 * The stages which may be reported depend on the type of connection being made. 
 * Stage information is usually read from a TNifProgress::iStage member.
 *
 * @publishedAll
 * @since		v5.0  
 * @deprecated	7.0s - maintained for compatibility with 6.1\n
 *				This enumeration is still used by the new RGenericAgent API.\n\n
 *				New software should use the CSD progress values defined in csdprog.h
 * 
 * \n
 * For a \b Dial \b Up \b Connection (outgoing call), the following stages are reported 
 * in this order \n 
 * (the meaning of each enumerator is defined in the enumeration values / member list, below):
 * -# EStartingSelection 
 * -# EFinishedSelection 
 * -# EStartingDialling 
 * -# EFinishedDialling 
 * -# EScanningScript 
 * -# EScannedScript 
 * -# EGettingLoginInfo 
 * -# EGotLoginInfo 
 * -# EStartingLogIn 
 * -# EFinishedLogIn 
 * -# EConnectionOpen 
 * -# EStartingHangUp 
 * -# EFinishedHangUp 
 *		   
 * For a \b Dial \b In \b Connection (incoming call), the following stages are
 * reported in this order: 
 * -# EStartingAnswer 
 * -# EAnswered 
 * -# EConnectionOpen 
 * -# EStartingHangUp 
 * -# EFinishedHangUp 
 *
 * For a \b Direct \b Connection, the following stages are reported in this order:
 * -# EStartingSelection 
 * -# EFinishedSelection 
 * -# EScanningScript 
 * -# EScannedScript 
 * -# EStartingConnect 
 * -# EFinishedConnect 
 * -# EConnectionOpen 
 * -# EStartingHangUp 
 * -# EFinishedHangUp
