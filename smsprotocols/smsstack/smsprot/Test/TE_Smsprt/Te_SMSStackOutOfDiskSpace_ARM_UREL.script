//! @SYMScriptTestEnvironment The test environment for this test suite requires the disk space to be set below a certain limit.  
//	 This limit is know to the "Disk Space Monitor" as the Low Limit.  For the purposes of this test suite, the test environment must be set
//	 below this limit.  
//	 Now, this limit is set in the SMS resource file:  \epoc32\data\Z\private\101f7989\sms\smsu.rsc.  The Disk Space Monitor accesses this file
//	 to determine this limit and others.  Anyhow, the SMS stack is reads this file from Z:\ for ARM UREL builds.  This is done because the licensee 
//	 will set these limits and that is how they will stay.  Nobody should be allowed to tamper with these values.  
//	 For all other builds, this file is read from C:\.  Now for test purposes, we can create our own file and set these limits to our preference.
//	 However, on ARM UREL, to run this suite, we have to fill the disk space so that it is below the default value set in z:\, which is 8K.  
//   From a client of Esock, it is not possible to fill the disk space above x bytes remaining.  We can therefore not obtain the test environment
//   for this test suite for it to be run under ARM UREL.  For this reason, this file has been created, and will be run under ARM UREL instances.
