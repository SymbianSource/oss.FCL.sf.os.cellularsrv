Setting default SCA in phone (+CSCA)
------------------------------------
The Motorola Timeport phone does adhere to the ETSI standards and will return ERROR for the below command...
	AT+CSCA="441632960000",145
To fix this problem the TSY should, after getting an ERROR on the above command, do the below command instead...
	AT+CSCA="+441632960000"

	
Motorola Timeport Does Not Seem To Support +CNMI command
--------------------------------------------------------
The phone always returns ERROR for +CNMI? and +CNMI=?.
