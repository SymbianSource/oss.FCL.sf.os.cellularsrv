3a. Include the RPS_Usage_Example.h in the <teststep>Server.cpp file.
3b. Add an extra else-if statement to create the RPSUsageExampleStep in the CreateTestStep() method in <teststep>Server.cpp
5.  Add an appropriate line for running the RPS_Usage_Example in the TE_Trp... script file located in
    z:\testdata\scripts.
