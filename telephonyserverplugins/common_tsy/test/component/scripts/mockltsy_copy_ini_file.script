// Description:
// Copies the file ltsydata_mock.ini from Z: (ROM or simulated ROM) to the C: drive
// Two reasons for doing this are:
//   a) It loads the MockLtsy dll (mocklicenseetsy.dll) as the one to use as the LTsy component
//   b) The file can be edited (or deleted) allowing fall-back to the "normal" licenseetsy.dll
//
//
