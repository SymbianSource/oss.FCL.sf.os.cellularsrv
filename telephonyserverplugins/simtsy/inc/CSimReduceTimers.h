/**
Implementation of MSimTimersSubject, used to listen to events
indicating a request to reduce the timers running in the simulator.
This implementation currently uses the Publish & Subscribe API to get a
notification of when a particular property is changed.  On
notification, all registered timer observers will be required to reduce
their timer's duration by the minimum time duration of all these
timers.

The notification must be made by changing a specific property, category
KUidPSSimTsyCategory and sub-key KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTime, to the
value KReduceSimTsyTimers.  (These constants are defined in "SimTsy.h")

Example:

@code
// Optional, but safe to attempt defining property.
TInt ret = RProperty::Define(KUidPSSimTsyCategory, KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTime,
								KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTimeSignalKeyType);
if (ret != KErrNone && ret != KErrAlreadyExists)
	{
	User::Leave(ret);
	}

RProperty stopTimerProperty;
// User's code must create a property handle attached to a property with the
// category KUidPSSimTsyCategory and sub-key KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTime.
User::LeaveIfError(stopTimerProperty.Attach(KUidPSSimTsyCategory, KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTime));
CleanupClosePushL(stopTimerProperty);

//... Use the simulator.

// The property must then be set to KReduceSimTsyTimers in order to indicate that
// the simulator is no longer required to continue running and thus timers can be reduced.
User::LeaveIfError(stopTimerProperty.Set(KUidPSSimTsyCategory, KPSSimTsyTimersReduceTime,
											KReduceSimTsyTimers));

CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy(&stopTimerProperty);
@endcode
