Please note that information on the current test code for this component can be found in the bld.inf file. Since the harnesses use ScheduleTest, the user should compile the latest version of ScheduleTest before compiling this test.

ScheduleTest can be found in networking/integrationtest and is built from the networking/integrationtest/group directory. The source code for the harnesses can be found in telephony\simtsy\<ts_harnessname>. The tests should be compiled from \telephony\simtsy\group directory.

For ease of merging test code defect fixes from Hurricane to 3GComms, the old test code is still present in the 3GComms_Hurricane branch but is not built.
