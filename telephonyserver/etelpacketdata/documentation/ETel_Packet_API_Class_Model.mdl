|==================
|
|This class encapsulates functionality associated with controlling the packet-switched connection. Attaching, Detaching, Notifying clients of a network-initiated context activation request, etc.
|
|The RPacketService class uses 1...n RPacketContext instances in order to control the configuration of each of its potentially multiple simultaneous connections to the packet network

|Contexts
|=======
|Every packet-swtiched connection to the network must have at least one context configuration that defines the connection to the packet network.
|
|Hence, every RPacket must have at least one RPacketContext. This is the "Primary Active Context".
|Secondary & Multiple active contexts are supported in this model also.

|===============
|
|This function will set the preferred bearer for the MT to default to when dropping from Class B operation to Class C, for instance when the MT moves into a Routing Area of cells or new packet-switched network which operates in Network Mode III. Class C operation requires that the MT is attached to either circuit-switched or packet-switched, not both. 
|
|Should the MT be a Class C only device, this function is used simply to switch bearers. If the required bearer is circuit-switched, the MT will immediately attempt to attach to the circuit- switched service. If packet-switched, the MT may either immediately attempt to attach to the packet service or wait until context activation to attach, depending on the current attach mode.

|class RPacketQoS
|=========
|The RPacketQoS class encapsulates functionality related to configuring Quality of Service options for a particular context (or "service configuration" in CDMA parlance). A context/service-configuration is represented by the RPacketContext class.
|
|RPacketQoS is network agnostic where possible. However some network-specific aspects are unavoidable if multimode ETel is to provide full support for QoS across GPRS Release 97/98, CDMA2000, Release 99 and Release 4. This is due to the difference of QoS specifications in each network.

|Main Packet Data API class model.
|Support for Packet Data services has been encapsulated in 3 R-classes: RPacketService, RPacketContext and RPacketQoS.  A single RPacketService class can have multiple (1n) RPacketContext instances. This maps to the specified scenario where a handset (RPhone) can potentially have multiple contexts defined for a particular packet data network. Similarly, a single context (RPacketContext instance) can have a predefined QoS for the context or not have any specific QoS for the given context (01 RPacketQoS instances).
