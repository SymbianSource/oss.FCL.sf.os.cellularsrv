# Description:
# Script:	Auto Capability Tag Insertion and Verification
# Author:	Mike Mingay
# Updated:	27th September 2004
# Version: 	1.7
# Usage
# This script should primarily be used to automatically insert Capability tags for specific functions, 
# specified in an excel spreadsheet, into source code. It secondarily can be used to confirm that capabilities
# already assigned in source code tags match those in the spreadsheet and if not, updates them appropriately.
# The spreadsheet location and format are easily customisable as long as the filename, class, 
# function and desired capability are listed in rows in the spreadsheet - referenced in the "DEFINITIONS" section below.
# Symbian components should be added as separate sheets and should be listed in the "COMPONENT LIST" below.
# This script should be run from the ROOT:\ of a subst subsystem drive (i.e. with ROOT:\Telephony or
# ROOT:\NbProtocols in our case etc). Ensure that the source has been checked out of 
# any source control application (PerForce for Symbian) or you will probably recieve read-only file warnings.
# Run "perl CapTag.pl" and it will process the specified components Two logfiles will be created:
# CapTagSummary.log details the progress of a run and CapTagError.log indicates any problems enountered. 
# Check the error logs as they will highlight any duplicate, missing or updated Capability tags that may need addressing.
# Comment in/out the components in the "COMPONENT LIST" at circa line 50 if you only need to process one or 
# a few components, If the spreadhseet format changes, simply update the "Definitions" section below. 
# Remember that the first row in the spreadsheet will be treated as a header row.
# If you wish to use the script on a non-Telephony related component, please update the locations specified 
# on +- line 184 within the "find(\&OpenFile" functions to reflect those in your subsystem.
# Version History and ToDo list
# 2004-08-04 Yuting Kuo		Updated to write one capability tag per line
# In the "ProcesComponent" sub we could use $numRows= $main::excelsheet->UsedRange->Rows->{Count}; 
# and $numColumns= $main::excelsheet->UsedRange->Columns->{Count}; to determine the data size instead of 
# fixed range but the script is so fast this wont be highly advantageous.
# We could start using $main::excel->{DisplayAlerts}=0; if there are excell warning messages we wish to squash
# A further check to confirm the the capabilities being read and assigned are valid (i.e (ReadUserData,
# NetworkServices etc.) in spelling and case would be useful.
