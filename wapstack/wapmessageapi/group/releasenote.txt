Change list number: 128473

Early release of new Hurricane WAP Messaging API.
This is being released into the mainline now so clients can start to implement code changes against this incomplete, but frozen API, release.

This is a new replacement API for part of the wapstack, but the existing APIs still remain at present, and so no clients will be effected by this components early release.

The new component has been added to the gt.txt file to be build as part of the mainline.
